## About

Hello reader,

I am known as Thanatos, although over the years, people have affectionately given me the nickname "Thotty." Consequently, my account bears the name ThottySploity. As a Rust programmer, my expertise lies in crafting unsafe and experimental code. I primarily devote my efforts to developing low-level red-team implementations for various scenarios. Through my code, I strive to provide educational insights into the functioning of specific implementations in real-world scenarios. I strongly caution against blindly copying and utilizing my work, as my primary objective revolves around facilitating learning rather than causing harm to anyone.

All the code I develop is licensed under the MIT license. While it is not my intention to create code specifically designed to bypass antivirus (AV) or Endpoint-Detection and Response (EDR) systems, it is possible that it may inadvertently have this effect. However, I want to clarify that I am not available to provide assistance or support to individuals seeking guidance on bypassing such systems. Although I possess expertise in this area, I consciously choose not to devote my time or be held responsible for enabling or encouraging such activities.

During my initial years as a bachelor's student, I embarked on a new project called mimikatz-rs. This project involved implementing mimikatz, a popular tool, using the Rust programming language. Through this endeavor, my passion for developing low-level code for red-team implementations was ignited. The development of mimikatz-rs served as a catalyst for my growing interest in pursuing security research.

Throughout my journey thus far, I have explored various domains such as IoT, networking, userland, and kernel-level exploitation. Among these areas, I find Active Directory hacking particularly intriguing. It presents a captivating field that captivates my attention and fuels my desire to delve deeper into its intricacies.
